# Frontend for Mobile Course App

## How to Run the Frontend

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to this `frontend` folder.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the static server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
5. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## How It Works

- This server will serve all your HTML, CSS, and JS files.
- Your JavaScript can make API requests to the backend (Spring Boot) running at `http://localhost:8080`.
- Make sure the backend is running before you try to register, log in, or fetch data.

## Project Structure

- All your HTML, CSS, and JS files are in this folder.
- The backend code is in the parent folder (`../src` and related files).
